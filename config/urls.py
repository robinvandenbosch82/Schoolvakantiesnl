# route. WhiteNoise only serves /static/, and the image pipeline writes WebP/JPEG
# variants to disk at runtime, so serving must be dynamic (per-request disk read)
# rather than a startup scan. On a single instance with a persistent volume this
# is fine; front it with object storage + a CDN if traffic ever warrants it.
