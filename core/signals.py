"""
Image post-processing on upload (ported pattern from the sibling sites).

When a content object with a PhotoMixin is saved with a freshly uploaded photo:
  1. sync photo_local to the uploaded file's path (so get_photo_url/source and
     the {% picture %} pipeline use it),
  2. compress the original in place if it's very large,
  3. pre-warm the responsive WebP/JPEG variants so the first page render is fast.

All steps are best-effort and never block a save. The `.update()` write avoids
triggering this signal recursively.
